# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
=============================================

## Introduction
------------

This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various diagnostic measurements using machine learning techniques. It utilizes Python and popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to analyze the dataset and build predictive models.

## Project Overview
-----------------

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and a carefully curated dataset, this project enables early detection and diagnosis of diabetes.

## Key Features
--------------

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: The project involves collecting a dataset containing features related to diabetes diagnosis, such as glucose levels, insulin levels, age, BMI, etc. Using Pandas and NumPy, the collected data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
- **Data Exploration**: The project employs data visualization techniques using Matplotlib or Seaborn to gain insights into the dataset.
- **Model Development**: The project uses several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to build predictive models.
- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
--------------------

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
  - **TensorFlow/Keras**: For deep learning models (optional)[2].

## Dataset
----------

The dataset used in this project is typically sourced from the UCI Repository and includes features such as:

- **Pregnancy**: Number of times pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration.
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure.
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness.
- **Insulin**: 2-hour serum insulin.
- **BMI**: Body mass index.
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: Diabetes pedigree function.
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Outcome**: Whether the patient has diabetes (0 or 1).
